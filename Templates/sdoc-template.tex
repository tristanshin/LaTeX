%% For example, suppose Problem 2 is        %%
%% "Solve for x: x + 3 = 5."                %%
%% Your solution would look like this:      %%

%% \begin{solution}{2}                      %%
%% If $x+3=5$, then subtract 3 from both    %%
%% sides of the equation to get $x=5-3=2$,  %%
%% so the solution is $x=2$.                %%

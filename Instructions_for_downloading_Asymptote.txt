3. Run the following commands in terminal:
	
	cd ~/Library
	mkdir Asymptote
	mv ~/Downloads/asymptote-x.xx.src.tgz Asymptote
	cd Asymptote
	gunzip asymptote-x.xx.src.tgz
	tar -xf asymptote-x.xx.src.tar
	cd asymptote-x.xx
	./configure
	make all
	sudo make install

4. At the last step, you will have to enter the root password.
